This repository is a project for CS294-190: Topics in Deep Reinforcement Learning taught by Pieter Abbeel and Stuart Russell (Fall 2021). In this project, we attempt to analyze different ablations and hyperparameter sweeps of implementations of AlphaZero performed on Tic-Tac-Toe. AlphaZero is a generalization of AlphaGo, which uses MCTS and a Neural Network to approximate the policy and the value function.
